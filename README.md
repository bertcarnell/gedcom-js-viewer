This repository is a fork of the [jswale/gedcom-js-viewer](https://github.com/jswale/gedcom-js-viewer) project.  The project
is very well written, but I will be modifying it for use in my own genealogy work.

Please note that the project was orginally licensed under the MIT license, and that license has been maintained.
